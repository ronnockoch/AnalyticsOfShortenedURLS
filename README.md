Updating Analytics for URL's Shortened by GoogleURL shortener in Sheets


Long story short; this code was written to automatically update a spreadsheet with values for how many times a goo.gl short link has been clicked for tracking purposes. Currently the data is organized in a set way and would require smallchanges to the code to make it easy to setup for others; if there's interest I can go through the code and make it easier to update where you want your information to go.
